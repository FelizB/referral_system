 
Referral System
A simple and flexible solution for referring customers.

Team
Felix Bosire - developer
Overview
The Referral System is a platform that will be a support system in organizations that mostly deal with clients/ large customer base where staffs will be measured according to their work rate and assisting fellow colleagues by a way of mutual support in referring customers. They will then be rewarded in accordance to the statistics at the end of the week or month. 
Objectives:
To design and develop an easy-to-use referral system that will be simple and reliable.
To provide users with the ability to record their support base and productivity level for the organization.
Methodology:
Requirements gathering: Conduct user research and gather requirements from potential users to understand their needs and pain points related to customer satisfaction.
Design and prototyping:
Use the gathered requirements to create wireframes and interactive prototypes of the application's user interface and user experience
Development: Use the final design and prototypes to develop the application using appropriate programming languages and technologies.
Testing: Conduct thorough testing of the application to ensure its functionality and usability.
Deployment: Deploy the application on appropriate platforms such as app stores and web servers.
Maintenance: Provide ongoing maintenance and support for the application to ensure its smooth operation and address any issues that may arise.
Technologies:
Libraries:
React.js for front-end development
Express.js for back-end development
Stripe for online payment processing
Axios for API calls
	Languages:
JavaScript (for frontend and backend development)
HTML/CSS (for designing the user interface)
No SQL for database management
Python for back end and API
	Platforms:
Node.js runtime environment (for backend integration)
React.js
	Frameworks:
Node.js Express Framework (for back-end development)
React for front-end development
	Books/Resources:
Building Applications with React and Redux" by Cory House
"Express.js in Action" by Evan Hahn
"SQL: The Complete Reference" by James Groff
GitHub for version control and project management
Stack Overflow for technical support and troubleshooting
W3schools for web development learning
MDN web docs for web development learning
AWS or GCP for hosting the application


Challenge:
The problem that the Portfolio Project is intended to solve is to provide a user-friendly and efficient Referral system application that allows users to easily refer customers and record their information easily.
Risks:
1. Technical risks, the potential impact, and what safeguards or alternatives
Data security and privacy risks: The application will collect and store personal information from users, such as their names, contact information, and payment details. To mitigate this risk, the application will implement secure protocols for data transmission and storage, such as SSL/TLS encryption and regular backups. Additionally, the application will comply with relevant data protection laws and regulations, such as GDPR.
Scalability risks: As the number of users increases, the application may not be able to handle the increased load. To mitigate this risk, the application will be built using scalable technologies and architecture, such as cloud-based hosting and microservices. Additionally, load testing will be conducted regularly to ensure that the application can handle the expected number of users.
Integration risks: The application will need to integrate with various third-party systems and services, such as payment gateways and barcode scanning devices. To mitigate this risk, thorough testing will be conducted for each integration and contingency plans will be in place in case of any issues.
2. non-technical risks, the potential impact, and strategies to prevent negative outcomes
Legal and regulatory risks: The application will need to comply with various laws and regulations related to data protection, consumer protection, and electronic transactions. To mitigate this risk, the application will be developed in consultation with legal experts and will be regularly updated to comply with any changes in laws and regulations.
Reputation risks: Negative customer experiences or data breaches can harm the reputation of the company and the application. To mitigate this risk, the application will be developed with a focus on user experience and security, and a robust customer service and incident response plan will be in place to address any issues that may arise.
Infrastructure:
For branching and merging in our team's repository, we will be using the Gitflow branching model. This model utilizes a "develop" branch for ongoing development, separate "feature" branches for individual changes, and a "master" branch for production-ready code. This allows for a clear separation between code that is ready for production and code that is still in development. We will also use pull requests to review and merge code changes into the develop branch.
Our strategy for deployment will be to use continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipeline. This will automate the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes to our production environment. We will use tools such as Jenkins or TravisCI for continuous integration and AWS CodeDeploy or Google Cloud Deployment Manager for continuous deployment.
Conclusion
This project aims to design and develop a system that will be efficient to the users and helpful to the organization in rewarding their employees for the support they offer each other. It will also help in a way to boost the morale of the employees in the organization.
